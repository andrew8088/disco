11ty is great, but I need something that works the way I think.

- generate files at their path, or at a custom path
- simple-yet-flexible data management
- works with yaml+markdown files ... or ts?
- config needs:
  - passthrough
  - file type config
  - syntax highlighting?
  - processing functions
  - collection creation
- basic fields
-
